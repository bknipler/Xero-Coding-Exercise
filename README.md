# Xero-Coding-Exercise
Coding Exercise for Xero recruitment

Created using Nunit & selenium webdriver (chrome)

Guide:
1. Clone repository locally
2. Open up solution using visual studios
3. Build solution - nuget packages should restored automatically
4. Once solution is built, go to Test -> Windows -> Test Explorer
5. Five tests should be available, you can either select 'Run All' at the top of the test explorer, or you can run them indiviually.
6. When a test is executing a chrome window should pop up and run through the test

NOTE: I had some tests randomly failing due to timeouts and I didn't have time to troubleshoot, if a test fails please try running again
